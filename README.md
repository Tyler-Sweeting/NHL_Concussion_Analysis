### Overview

Our group decided to focus our attention onto an analysis involving something in the sports world. In recent years, the NHL has been riticuled for its handling of player concussions and the potential long-term effects on their health and careers. Our hope is for this analysis to provide a data-driven perspective on the issue.

The data we used in this analysis is sourced from various publicly available datasets on NHL players and their careers. The analysis focuses on several key metrics, including the number of concussions sustained by players, the amount of games missed because of those concussions, and the effect they have on a players performance and longevity in the league.

The project will be implemented using Python and JavaScript. The data will be cleaned and pre-processed to ensure its quality before performing exploratory data analysis to identify trends and insights. Additionally, statistical models will be used to quantify the relationship between concussions and career outcomes. We will have an interactive aspect to the analysis for more detailed answers, this will be done on a created website as well as a Tableau story.

The results of this analysis may provide awareness for the NHL and its stakeholders to better understand the long-term impact of concussions on player health and career longevity. Ultimately, this information may help inform future policies and practices to improve player safety and well-being.
